## Purpose and scope of the application

### What does ToDoList CLI do?

The ToDoList CLI is a command line interface application that works as a to do list. This application turns your command line into an easy to use notepad, that conveniently stores notes for later use. These notes can be created, read, updated and deleted at the user's ease of command. When the application is launched a simple menu appears asking the user what actions they would like to take. This menu will change depending on how the user interacts with it and continue to give helpful instrucitons to guide the user through using the application. The user will also be informed that they can type `-h` or `help` at any time to receive further instructions if they are confused. The user will also be told how to exit the application by typing `q` or `quit` at any time.

### What problem does this app solve? and why am I developing it?

This application solves the issue of not being able to use a notepad without opening a large, detailed, bloated application. Most notepad applications will be overly convoluted, rather than simple and elegant like ToDoList CLI. Most notepad applications require you to find the app in your ever growing list of unused apps, boot it up, wait for it to open, and navigate a clunky GUI just to write down that you need some milk. I'm developing ToDoList CLI so you can `CTRL + ALT + T` and type "I NEED MILK" before your friend using "Super Notes App 3k" can even find their app.

### Target audience and how they will use it

The target audience for this app is anyone that understands how to use the command line. If you can use the command line, then you can use ToDoList CLI. This target user will be going about their day-to-day tasks when they suddenly think or something they need to remember later. `CTRL + ALT + T` and write it down, ToDoList CLI is coming to your town.
